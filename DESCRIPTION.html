Probably the sharpest <b>git repository organizer</b> and <b>rebase/merge workflow automation</b> tool you've ever seen! <br/><br/>

This plugin adds an extra tab in the Git tool window that gives an instant answer to the questions:
<ul>
  <li>What are the branches in this repository?</li>
  <li>What needs be merged/rebased/pushed/pulled?</li>
</ul>

The <i>bird's eye view</i> provided by Git Machete makes <b>rebases/push/pulls hassle-free</b>
even when <b>multiple branches</b> are present in the repository:
master/develop, your topic branches, teammate's branches checked out for review etc. <br/><br/>

Along these lines, Git Machete helps create and maintain <b>small, focused, easy-to-review PRs</b>.<br/><br/>
