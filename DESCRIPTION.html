Probably the sharpest git repository organizer and rebase/merge workflow automation tool you've ever seen!

This plugin adds an extra tab in the Git tool window that gives the instant answer to the questions:
<i>what are the branches in this repository? what needs be merged/rebased/pushed/pulled?</i> <br/><br/>

The bird's eye view provided by Git Machete makes rebases/push/pulls hassle-free
even when multiple branches are present in the repository:
master/develop, your topic branches, teammate's branches checked out for review etc. <br/><br/>

Along these lines, Git Machete helps in creating and maintaining small, focused, easy-to-review PRs.<br/><br/>
